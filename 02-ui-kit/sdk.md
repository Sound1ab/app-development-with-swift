## Auto layout

![](images/constraints.png)

If you want a button to stay in the exact center, regardless of screen size or orientation, you'll need to create a set of constraints, or rules. This system of using constraints to make adaptive interfaces is called Auto Layout.


## Stacks

Stack views are great for combining views together and organising them. Think of them as flexbox containers.

They conform to the size of their contents.
