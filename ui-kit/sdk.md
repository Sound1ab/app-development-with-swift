## UIKit - sdk

A view is a clear rectangular shape that can be customized to display anything on the screen. Text, images, lines, and graphics are all created using instances of UIView.

To display a view onscreen, you need to give it a frame—which consists of a size and a position—and add it to the view hierarchy. The area within the view is its bounds.
